/** @file fourier_smg.c Documented fourier_smg module

 * Emilio Bellini, Ignacy Sawicki, Miguel Zumalacarregui, TODO_EB: date here xx.xx.xxxx
 *
 * Additional functions for the fourier module.
 * It contains all the hi_class related functions (_smg)
 * that are used by fourier.c. In this way the main hi_class
 * modifications are stored here and the standard Class modules
 * remain cleaner.
 *
 * The following nomenclature has been adopted:
 *
 * -# all the functions end with "_smg" to make them easily
 *    recognizable
 * -# all the functions starting with "fourier_" are
 *    directly called by fourier.c or the classy wrapper
 * -# all the functions that do not start with "fourier_"
 *    are only used internally in fourier_smg.c

 * method presented in Mead et al. 1505.07833.
 * For now corrections have been calculated only for Jordan-Brans-Dicke
 * models with a procedure described in Joudaki et al. 2010.15278.

 * @param pba        Input: pointer to background structure
 * @param z_at_tau   Input: redshift, at which to compute the nl correction
 * @param Delta_v_0  Input/Output: value of the virialized overdensity
