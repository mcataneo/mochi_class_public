# gr_smg runs before qs_smg, i.e.
# - if gr_smg = on, you can not get full evolution
# - if gr_smg = off, it can be either fully_dynamic or quasi_static depdending on qs_smg

# Changes:
# - things to discuss are marked with TODO_GR_SMG
# - pba->a_smg => pba->a_file_gr_smg (to be more descriptive and easier to find in the code). Consider moving this to precision (even better, get it automatically from files)
# - I would like to remove: ppt->set_late_ic_smg.
# - Reconsider the role of pba->gravity_model_smg == stable_params. If it is the general model that is read from file maybe replace: stable_params -> from_file (or similar)
# - a_file_gr_smg and z_gr_smg were the same parameter. I would keep them separate and probably get a_file_gr_smg directly from input file
