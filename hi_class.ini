# ----------------------------
# ----> background parameters:
# ----------------------------

# 1a) Omega_smg is the fractional density of the scalar field today. There are three possibilities
#     i)    Omega_smg unspecified or equivalently set to 0. In this case the code will
#           ignore the scalar field equations and will use the standard CLASS equations
#     ii)   Omega_smg has a value larger than 0 but smaller than 1. In this case you should
#           leave either Omega_Lambda or Omega_fld unspecified. Then, hi_class will run# default: no
#           with the scalar field equations, and Omega_Lambda or Omega_fld will be inferred
#           using the closure equation (sum_i Omega_i) equals (1 + Omega_k)
#     iii)  Omega_smg has a negqative value. In this case the equations for the scalar field
#           will be used, you have to specify both Omega_Lambda and Omega_fld, and Omega_smg will
#           be inferred by the code using the closure equation
#     (see the "explanatory.ini" file for details on perfect fluid options)

Omega_Lambda = 0 
Omega_fld = 0
Omega_smg = -1


# 1b) For debugging purposes one can replace Omega_smg -> Omega_smg_debug 
#     (Omega_smg_debug won't be read unless Omega_smg is left unspecified).
#     In this case the code will not attempt to adjust Omega_smg, the closure relation will
#     not be satisfied, unless the guessed parameters are correct

# Omega_smg_debug = 0.


# ----------------------------------
# ----> modified gravity parameters:
# ----------------------------------

# 2)  hi_class can handle two types of gravity models
#     i)    covariant theories are based on a scalar-tensor Lagrangian (see Bellini+ 1909.01828) 
#     ii)   parameterized modifications of gravity are based on the EFT of DE (see Zumalacarregui+ 1605.06102)
#     The theory of gravity is specified through "gravity_model" with parameter values in "parameters_smg".
#     For parameterizations, one needs to specify an additional "expansion_model" with parameters "expansion_smg" (see below)

# 2a) In covariant models the parameters control both the expansion history and perturbations
#     (internally, covariant theories are distinguished via the "field_evolution_smg" flag)
#     One of the paramters needs to be varied to fix the value of Omega_smg (see 2d)
#     Currently the following covariant theories are implemented
#     i)    "brans dicke"
#     ii)   "monomial quintessence"
#     iii)  "galileon" (includes "cubic galileon", "quartic galileon" and "quintic galileon"
#     iv)   "nkgb" (Kinetic Gravity Braiding)
#     The parameters of each covariant theory are explained in a separate "theory_name.ini" file
#     located in the "gravity_models" directory

gravity_model = brans dicke 
parameters_smg =   0.7, 50, 1., 1.e-1


# 2b) For parameterizations the theory of gravity is described by the alpha functions at the linear level.
#     There are several possible parametrizations of the alpha functions currently implemented
#     i)    "propto_omega": all the alphas are proportional to the fractional density of the Dark
#           Energy fluid at the background. Then, you have to provide a vector containg the
#           factor of proportionality of each alpha and the initial value of the Planck Mass
#     ii)   "propto_scale": all the alphas are proportional to the scale factor. Then, you have
#           to provide a vector containg the factor of proportionality of each alpha and the
#           initial value of the Planck Mass
#     iii)  "constant_alphas": all the alphas are constant in time. Then, you have to provide a
#           vector containg the value of each alpha and the initial value of the Planck Mass
#     iv)   "eft_alphas_power_law": delta_M, alpha_{K, B, T} are proportional to the scale factor to
# 	  some power. Then, you have to provide a vector containg eight parameters, the four
# 	  proportionality constants and the four exponents of the scale factor. This generalize
# 	  the "propto_scale" parametrization with the remarkable exception that in that case
# 	  alpha_M was proportional to the scale factor, while here it is the Planck mass that
# 	  scales with the scale factor
#     v)    "eft_gammas_power_law": this parametrization uses the basis of the eft framework
# 	  (Omega, gamma_i) and assumes that they are power laws of the scale factor
# 	  (g1_0*pow(a,g1_exp)). You have to provide a vector containing eight parameters,
# 	  the four proportionality constants and the four exponents of the scale factor
#     vi)   "eft_gammas_exponential": this parametrization uses the basis of the eft framework
# 	  (Omega, gamma_i) and assumes that they are exponentials in the scale factor. In a
# 	  schematic way it reads: exp(gi_0*pow(a,gi_exp))-1. You have to provide a vector
# 	  containing eight parameters, the four proportionality constants and the four
# 	  exponents of the scale factor
#     The parametrization you want to used is stored in the variable "gravity_model", while the
#     value of the parameters is stored in the vector "parameters_smg"
#     i)    "propto_omega" -> x_k, x_b, x_m, x_t, M*^2_ini (default)
#     ii)   "propto_scale" -> x_k, x_b, x_m, x_t, M*^2_ini
#     iii)  "constant_alphas" -> x_k, x_b, x_m, x_t, M*^2_ini
#     iv)   "eft_alphas_power_law" -> delta_M_0, x_k, x_b, x_t, delta_M_0_exp, x_k_exp, x_b_exp, x_t_exp
#     v)    "eft_gammas_power_law" -> Om_0, g_1, g_2, g_3, Om_0_exp, g_1_exp, g_2_exp, g_3_exp
#     vi)   "eft_gammas_exponential" -> Om_0, g_1, g_2, g_3, Om_0_exp, g_1_exp, g_2_exp, g_3_exp


#gravity_model = propto_omega
#parameters_smg = 1., 0., 0., 0., 1.


# 2c) When choosing parameterizations one needs to provide an expansion history of the universe.
#     i)    "lcdm": fixes the expansion history to be the one predicted by a cosmological constant
#     ii)   "wowa": introduces a fluid with equation of state p/rho equal to w0+wa(1-a/a0)
#     iii)  " wede": early dark energy + constant equation of state at late times  (Doran-Robbers model astro-ph/0601544 implemented as in Pettorino et al. 1301.5279)
#     This information is stored in the "expansion_model" variable. After specifying it, you have
#     to provide the values for the parameters to fully specify the parametrization you chose. These
#     are stored in the vector "expansion_smg"
#     i)    "lcdm" -> Omega_smg (default)
#     ii)   "wowa" -> Omega_smg, w0, wa
#     iii)  "wede" -> Omega_smg, w0, Omega_ede

expansion_model = lcdm
expansion_smg = 0.5 #this value will be overwritten using the closure equation.
# expansion_model = wowa
# expansion_smg = 0.5, -1., 0.


# 2d) Given a vector containing the values of the parameters needed to fully fix the background
#     evolution you chose, you should specify which parameter you want to vary to satisfy the
#     closure equation (tuning_index_smg, default: 0) and  your initial guess on how much you want
#     to vary it (tuning_dxdy_guess_smg, default: 1)
#     This choice is necessary for covariant theories and parameterizations

# tuning_index_smg = 0
# tuning_dxdy_guess_smg = 1.


# 2e) Parameter controling how much smg information do you want on the background.dat file
#     (works as _verbose parameters, all lower priority are included)
#     0 -> rho,p
#     1 -> alpha functions, stability parameters (c_s^2, D)
#     2 -> phi, phi', phi'' and Friedmann constraint equations (only covariant theories)
#     3 -> functions useful to calculate perturbations (lambda_i, ...)

output_background_smg = 3


# ---------------------------
# ----> stability parameters:
# ---------------------------

# 3a) The absence of ghost and gradient instabilities is tested in the code for both scalars
#     and tensors. It is possible to avoid these tests altoghether by changing

skip_stability_tests_smg = no 

# 3b) If skip_stability_tests_smg is set to no, it is possible to relax the stability conditions
#     to accept slightly negative values  (moslty to avoid numerical noise around 0).
#     Indeed, the code internally verify that the following conditions are satisfied at all times
#     i)    cs2_smg > - abs(cs2_safe_smg). Sound speed of the scalar sector
#     ii)   ct2_smg > - abs(ct2_safe_smg). Sound speed of the tensor sector
#     iii)  D_smg > - abs(D_safe_smg). Kinetic term of the scalar sector
#     iv)   M2_smg > - abs(M2_safe_smg). Kinetic term of the tensor sector
#     Negative values skip a test altogether (all default values are zero)

cs2_safe_smg = 0.
D_safe_smg = 0.
ct2_safe_smg = 0.
M2_safe_smg = 0.

# 3c) It is also possible to omit stability tests before a certain scale factor (default 0).
#     Useful for models where the stability failure is due to numerical errors (e.g. brans_dicke)

a_min_stability_test_smg = 1e-6


# ----------------------------------------
# ----> background integration parameters:
# ----------------------------------------

# 4a) hi_class integrates a combination of the dynamical equation and the Friedmann constraint
#     to avoid problems associated with having different branches and constraint violations due to
#     numerical integration. The constraint acts as a friction term
#     i)    evolve the dynamical equation (change uses the constraint equation and will NOT work for most Lagrangian-based theories)
#     ii)   coefficient to the constraint-damping friction term 

hubble_evolution = y 
hubble_friction = 3. 


# -------------------------------------------------
# ----> perturbation initial conditions parameters:
# -------------------------------------------------

# 5a) There are two possible initial conditions for the perturbations of the scalar field
#     i)     "ext_field_attr": assumes that scalar does not gravitate (no modified gravity) at early times
#            but only follows the superhorizon potential created by radiation (default)
#     ii)    "gravitating_attr": allows the scalar to gravitate (gravity is modified) at early times
#            modifying the superhorizon evolution of other species.
#     iii)   "single_clock": single_clock IC given with respect to photons
#     iv)    "zero": set the initial value of the scalar field and its first derivative to 0

pert_initial_conditions_smg = ext_field_attr

# 5b) Precision parameters used to set/test initial conditions: for certain choices of parameters models, 
#     it may well be that a new fast growing mode appears. This would then dominate the initial evolution 
#     and decouple the initial conditions from those given by inflation. We test to disallow such situations.
#     i)     pert_ic_ini_z_ref_smg -> redshift at which initial IC stability test performed */
#     ii)    pert_ic_tolerance_smg -> tolerance to deviations from standard ICs h~tau^2 as evaluated at redshift pert_ic_ini_z_ref_smg (negative values override test)
#     iii)   pert_ic_regulator_smg -> minimum size of denominator in IC expressions: regulate to prevent infinities (negative values set off regulator)
#     iv)    pert_qs_ic_tolerance_test_smg -> Max contribution of QS SMG at superhorizon scales to zeta non-conservation as fraction of standard contributon from radiation
    
    
pert_ic_ini_z_ref_smg = 1e10    
pert_ic_tolerance_smg = 2e-2 
pert_ic_regulator_smg = 1e-15
pert_qs_ic_tolerance_test_smg = 10
    

# --------------------------------------------
# ----> quasi-static approximation parameters:
# --------------------------------------------

# 6a) This function set the method used for the qs_smg approximation during the run of the code.
#     The options are:
#     i)    "automatic" -> uses the approximation scheme implemented
#     ii)   "fully_dynamic" -> forces the fully-dynamical evolution of the perturbations at all times (default)
#     iii)  "quasi_static" -> forces the quasi-static evolution of the perturbations at all times
#     iv)   "fully_dynamic_debug" -> forces the fully-dynamic evolution but evaluates the approximation scheme
#     v)    "quasi_static_debug" -> forces the quasi-static evolution but evaluates the approximation scheme

method_qs_smg = fully_dynamic

# 6b) Precision parameters used in the quasi-static approximation (only if "automatic" is used)
#     i)    z_fd_qs_smg -> minimum redshift after which the user requires the fully-dynamic evolution
#     ii)   trigger_mass_qs_smg -> minimum effective mass above which the quasi-static approximation is switched on
#     iii)  trigger_rad_qs_smg -> minimum radiation trigger for quasi-static approximation
#     iv)   eps_s_qs_smg -> minimum relative decay of oscillating solution before switching on quasi-static approximation
#     Note that all the conditions need to be satisfied for the quasi-static approximation to be used

z_fd_qs_smg = 10. 
trigger_mass_qs_smg = 1.e3 
trigger_rad_qs_smg = 1.e3 
eps_s_qs_smg = 0.01

# 6c) Sampling to determine intervals for quasi-static approximation
#     i)    n_min_qs_smg -> minimum number of steps used to sample quantities in the quasi-static approximation 
#     ii)   n_max_qs_smg -> maximum number of steps used to sample quantities in the quasi-static approximation 
    
n_min_qs_smg = 1e2 
n_max_qs_smg = 1e4 


# ---------------------------
# ----> precision parameters:
# ---------------------------

# 7a) Sometimes the evolution of the perturbations is slown down due to the presence of rapid
#     oscillations of the scalar field at early times. We noticed that it is possible to speed
#     up the code by artificially adding a constant value to the kineticity. This should not
#     affect observable scales, but you use it at your own risk! (default: 0.)
#     NOTE: it is advised to use a QS approximation instead (after V2)

# kineticity_safe_smg = 1e-4

# 7b) When studying early dark energy models, sometimes the code complaints if radiation is
#     not sufficiently dominant at early times. Then, you can try to modify the CLASS precision
#     parameter tol_initial_Omega_r (default: 1.e-4)

# tol_initial_Omega_r = 1.e-4

# 7c) We noticed that some precision parameter of CLASS has to be modified to get precise enough
#     results in hi_class. We then changed their default values in "source/input.c". These are

start_small_k_at_tau_c_over_tau_h = 1e-4
start_large_k_at_tau_h_over_tau_k = 1e-4
perturbations_sampling_stepsize = 0.05
l_logstep = 1.045
l_linstep = 50


# --------------------------------
# ----> standard CLASS parameters:
# --------------------------------

# 8) Here we report for completeness some parameters that are present in CLASS, see explanatory.ini
#    for details.

# 8a) list of output spectra requested

output = tCl,pCl,lCl,mPk

# 8b) file name root 'root' for all output files
