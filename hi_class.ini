----------------------------
----> background parameters:
----------------------------

1a) Omega_smg is the fractional density of the scalar field today. There are three possibilities
    i)    Omega_smg unspecified or equivalently set to 0. In this case the code will
          ignore the scalar field equations and will use the standard CLASS equations
    ii)   Omega_smg has a value larger than 0 but smaller than 1. In this case you should
          leave either Omega_Lambda or Omega_fld unspecified. Then, hi_class will run
          with the scalar field equations, and Omega_Lambda or Omega_fld will be inferred
          using the closure equation (sum_i Omega_i) equals (1 + Omega_k)
    iii)  Omega_smg has a negqative value. In this case the equations for the scalar field
          will be used, you have to specify both Omega_Lambda and Omega_fld, and Omega_smg will
          be inferred by the code using the closure equation

Omega_Lambda = 0 # fractional density of the cosmological constant today
Omega_fld = 0 # fractional density of a perfect fluid today, see the "explanatory.ini" file for details on this fluid
Omega_smg = -1 # fractional density of the DE field today. If it is specified to a given value, then need to comment Omega_Lambda or Omega_fld


1b) For debugging purposes one can specify Omega_smg_debug AND unspecify Omega_smg,fld,Lambda.
    In this case the closure equation is not satisfied in general

# Omega_smg_debug = 0.

1c) There are two possible expansion histories of the universe currently implemented
    i)   "lcdm": fixes the expansion history to be the one predicted by a cosmological constant
    ii)  "wowa": introduces a fluid with equation of state p/rho equal to w0+wa(1-a/a0)
    This information is stored in the "expansion_model" variable. After specifying it, you have
    to provide the values for the parameters to fully specify the parametrization you chose. These
    are stored in the vector "expansion_smg"
    i)   "lcdm" -> Omega_smg (default)
    ii)  "wowa" -> Omega_smg, w0, wa

expansion_model = lcdm
expansion_smg = 0.5 #this value will be overwritten using the closure equation. See below
# expansion_model = wowa
# expansion_smg = 0.5, -1., 0.

1c) Given a vector containing the values of the parameters needed to fully fix the background
    evolution you chose, you should specify which parameter you want to vary to satisfy the
    closure equation (tuning_index_smg, default: 0) and  your initial guess on how much you want 
    to vary it (tuning_dxdy_guess_smg, default: 1)

# tuning_index_smg = 0
# tuning_dxdy_guess_smg = 1.


------------------------------
----> gravity parameters:
------------------------------


2a) The theory of gravity is described by the alpha functions at the linear level.
    There are four possible parametrizations of the alpha functions currently implemented
    i)    "propto_omega": all the alphas are proportional to the fractional density of the Dark
          Energy fluid at the background. Then, you have to provide a vector containg the
          factor of proportionality of each alpha and the initial value of the Planck Mass
    ii)   "propto_scale": all the alphas are proportional to the scale factor. Then, you have
          to provide a vector containg the factor of proportionality of each alpha and the
          initial value of the Planck Mass
    iii)  "eft_alphas_power_law": delta_M, alpha_{K, B, T} are proportional to the scale factor to
	  some power. Then, you have to provide a vector containg eight parameters, the four 
	  proportionality constants and the four exponents of the scale factor. This generalize
	  the "propto_scale" parametrization with the remarkable exception that in that case
	  alpha_M was proportional to the scale factor, while here it is the Planck mass that
	  scales with the scale factor
    iv)   "eft_gammas_power_law": this parametrization uses the basis of the eft framework
	  (Omega, gamma_i) and assumes that they are power laws of the scale factor
	  (g1_0*pow(a,g1_exp)). You have to provide a vector containing eight parameters,
	  the four proportionality constants and the four exponents of the scale factor
    v)    "eft_gammas_exponential": this parametrization uses the basis of the eft framework
	  (Omega, gamma_i) and assumes that they are exponentials in the scale factor. In a
	  schematic way it reads: exp(gi_0*pow(a,gi_exp))-1. You have to provide a vector
	  containing eight parameters, the four proportionality constants and the four
	  exponents of the scale factor
    The parametrization you want to used is stored in the variable "gravity_model", while the
    value of the parameters is stored in the vector "parameters_smg"
    i)    "propto_omega" -> x_k, x_b, x_m, x_t, M*^2_ini (default)
    ii)   "propto_scale" -> x_k, x_b, x_m, x_t, M*^2_ini
    iii)  "eft_alphas_power_law" -> delta_M_0, x_k, x_b, x_t, delta_M_0_exp, x_k_exp, x_b_exp, x_t_exp
    iv)   "eft_gammas_power_law" -> Om_0, g_1, g_2, g_3, Om_0_exp, g_1_exp, g_2_exp, g_3_exp
    v)    "eft_gammas_exponential" -> Om_0, g_1, g_2, g_3, Om_0_exp, g_1_exp, g_2_exp, g_3_exp


gravity_model = propto_omega
parameters_smg = 1., 0., 0., 0., 1.

2b) There are two possible initial conditions for the perturbations of the scalar field
    i)   "single_clock": single_clock IC given with respect to photons (default)
    ii)  "zero": set the initial value of the scalar field and its first derivative to 0

pert_initial_conditions_smg = single_clock


---------------------------
----> stability parameters:
---------------------------

3a) The absence of ghost and gradient instabilities is tested in the code for both scalars
    and tensors. It is possible to avoid these tests altoghether by changing

skip_stability_tests_smg = no # default: no

3b) If skip_stability_tests_smg is set to no, it is possible to relax the stability conditions
    to accept slightly negative values  (moslty to avoid numerical noise around 0). 
    Indeed, the code internally verify that the following conditions are satisfied at all times
    (all default values are zero)
    i)    cs2_smg > - abs(cs2_safe_smg). Sound speed of the scalar sector
    ii)   ct2_smg > - abs(ct2_safe_smg). Sound speed of the tensor sector
    iii)  D_smg > - abs(D_safe_smg). Kinetic term of the scalar sector
    iv)   M2_smg > - abs(M2_safe_smg). Kinetic term of the tensor sector
      
cs2_safe_smg = 0.
D_safe_smg = 0.
ct2_safe_smg = 0.
M2_safe_smg = 0. 


---------------------------
----> precision parameters:
---------------------------

4a) Sometimes the evolution of the perturbations is slown down due to the presence of rapid
    oscillations of the scalar field at early times. We noticed that it is possible to speed
    up the code by artificially adding a constant value to the kineticity. This should not
    affect observable scales, but you use it at your own risk! (default: 0.)

# kineticity_safe_smg = 1e-4

4b) When studying early dark energy models, sometimes the code complaints if radiation is
    not sufficiently dominant at early times. Then, you can try to modify the CLASS precision
    parameter tol_initial_Omega_r (default: 1.e-4)

# tol_initial_Omega_r = 1.e-4

4c) We noticed that some precision parameter of CLASS has to be modified to get precise enough
    results in hi_class. We then changed their default values in "source/input.c". These are

start_small_k_at_tau_c_over_tau_h = 1e-4
start_large_k_at_tau_h_over_tau_k = 1e-4
perturb_sampling_stepsize = 0.05
l_logstep = 1.045
l_linstep = 50


--------------------------------
