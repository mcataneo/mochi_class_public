----------------------------
----> background parameters:
----------------------------

1a) Omega_smg is the fractional density of the scalar field today. There are three possibilities
    i)    Omega_smg unspecified or equivalently set to 0. In this case the code will
          ignore the scalar field equations and will use the standard CLASS equations
    ii)   Omega_smg has a value larger than 0 but smaller than 1. In this case you should
          leave either Omega_Lambda or Omega_fld unspecified. Then, hi_class will run
          with the scalar field equations, and Omega_Lambda or Omega_fld will be inferred
          using the closure equation (sum_i Omega_i) equals (1 + Omega_k)
    iii)  Omega_smg has a negqative value. In this case the equations for the scalar field
          will be used, you have to specify both Omega_Lambda and Omega_fld, and Omega_smg will
          be inferred by the code using the closure equation

Omega_Lambda = 0 # fractional density of the cosmological constant today
Omega_fld = 0 # fractional density of a perfect fluid today, see the "explanatory.ini" file for details on this fluid
Omega_smg = -1 # fractional density of the DE field today. If it is specified to a given value, then need to comment Omega_Lambda or Omega_fld


1b) For now, there are two possible expansion histories of the universe
    i)   "lcdm": fixes the expansion history to be the one predicted by a cosmological constant
    ii)  "wowa": introduces a fluid with equation of state p/rho equal to w0+wa(1-a/a0)
    This information is stored in the "expansion_model" variable. After specifying it, you have
    to provide the values for the parameters to fully specify the parametrization you chose. These
    are stored in the vector "expansion_smg"
    i)   "lcdm" -> Omega_smg (default)
    ii)  "wowa" -> Omega_smg, w0, wa

expansion_model = lcdm
expansion_smg = 0.5 #this value will be overwritten using the closure equation. See below
# expansion_model = wowa
# expansion_smg = 0.5, -1., 0.

1c) Given a vector containing the values of the parameters needed to fully fix the background
    evolution you chose, you should specify which parameter you want to vary to satisfy the
    closure equation (tuning_index_smg, default: 0) and how much you want to vary it
    (tuning_dxdy_guess_smg, default: 1)

# tuning_index_smg = 0
# tuning_dxdy_guess_smg = 1.


------------------------------
----> perturbation parameters:
------------------------------

2a) There are two possible initial conditions for the perturbations of the scalar field
    i)   "single_clock": single_clock IC given with respect to photons (default)
    ii)  "zero": set the initial value of the scalar field and its first derivative to 0

pert_initial_conditions_smg = single_clock

2b) At the perturbation level, there are four possible parametrizations of the alpha functions
    i)    "propto_omega": all the alphas are proportional to the fractional density of the Dark
          Energy fluid at the background. Then, you have to provide a vector containg the
          factor of proportionality of each alpha and the initial value of the Planck Mass
    ii)   "propto_scale": all the alphas are proportional to the scale factor. Then, you have
          to provide a vector containg the factor of proportionality of each alpha and the
          initial value of the Planck Mass
    iii)  "planck_linear": this parametrization depends on one single parameter. It was used
          by the Planck collaboration in 1502.01590 (this reference provides all the details
          about this parametrization)
    iv)   "planck_exponential": this parametrization depends on two parameters. It was used
          by the Planck collaboration in 1502.01590 (this reference provides all the details
          about this parametrization)
    The parametrization you want to used is stored in the variable "gravity_model", while the
    value of the parameters is stored in the vector "parameters_smg"
    i)    "propto_omega" -> c_k, c_b, c_m, c_t, M*^2_ini (default)
    ii)   "propto_scale" -> c_k, c_b, c_m, c_t, M*^2_ini
    iii)  "planck_linear" -> Omega_0
    iv)   "planck_exponential" -> alpha_M0, beta

gravity_model = propto_omega
parameters_smg = 1., 0., 0., 0., 1.


---------------------------
----> stability parameters:
---------------------------

3a) The absence of ghost and gradient instabilities is tested in the code for both scalars
    and tensors. It is possible to avoid these tests using

skip_stability_tests_smg = no # default: no

3b) If skip_stability_tests_smg is set to no, it is possible to relax the stability conditions
    (moslty to avoid numerical noise around 0). Indeed, the code internally verify that
    i)    cs2_smg > - abs(cs2_safe_smg). Sound speed of the scalar sector
    ii)   ct2_smg > - abs(ct2_safe_smg). Sound speed of the tensor sector
    iii)  D_smg > - abs(D_safe_smg). Kinetic term of the scalar sector
    iv)   M2_smg > - abs(M2_safe_smg). Kinetic term of the tensor sector
      
cs2_safe_smg = 0. # threshold to consider the sound speed of scalars negative in the stability check
D_safe_smg = 0. # threshold to consider the kinetic term of scalars negative in the stability check
ct2_safe_smg = 0. # threshold to consider the sound speed of tensors negative in the stability check
M2_safe_smg = 0. # threshold to consider the kinetic term of tensors (M2) negative in the stability check


---------------------------
----> precision parameters:
---------------------------

4a) Sometimes the evolution of the perturbations is slown down due to the presence of rapid
    oscillations of the scalar field at early times. We noticed that it is possible to speed
    up the code by artificially adding a constant value to the kineticity. This should not
    affects observable scales, but you use it at your own risk! (default: 0.)

# kineticity_safe_smg = 1e-4

4b) When studying early dark energy models, sometimes the code complaints if radiation is
    not sufficiently dominant at early times. Then, you can try to modify the CLASS precision
    parameter tol_initial_Omega_r (default: 1.e-4)

# tol_initial_Omega_r = 1.e-4

4c) We noticed that some precision parameter of CLASS has to be modified to get precise enough
    results in hi_class. We then changed their default values in "source/input.c". These are

start_small_k_at_tau_c_over_tau_h = 1e-4
start_large_k_at_tau_h_over_tau_k = 1e-4
perturb_sampling_stepsize = 0.05
l_logstep = 1.045
l_linstep = 50


--------------------------------
----> standard CLASS parameters:

5) Here we report for completeness some parameters that are present in CLASS, see explanatory.ini
   for details.

    of background quantitites in a file?

write parameters = yeap
write background = yeah
